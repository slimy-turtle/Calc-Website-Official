                    <p>The first thing you should understand is that this is very much an AP course. If you don't have an interest in pursing math in college and beyond or don't enjoy being challenged, this course is not for you. It is very rigourous and demanding course. If you are still on this page and would like to learn more about the class please scroll down.</p>

                            <p>Expect to have homework everyday with Problem Sets once a Unit. Problem Sets are similar to a take home quiz worth usually 15-20 points. The teachers will not force you to do any of your homework but it does count as 2 homework points in the gradebook, which can save your grade.</p>

                            <p>Both quizzes and tests are timed. Quizzes are usually a max of 30 min and tests are the whole period. When listing the order of least to most difficult assingments, it would go Notes, Homeworks, Problem Sets, Quizzes, and Tests. Although the assingments gradually get more difficult, it is benefitical to complete homework and try on the quizzes because the concepts are often replicated onto the tests. </p>

                            <p>The AB Calculus exam tests your knowledge on how well you know how to integrate multiple Calculus topics into a specific problem. Lots of connections between Limits, Derivatives, and Integrals, which will be explained in more detail later on. There will be one mandatory AP Exam as well as an extra one to help prepare you. The exam is 4 hours long with only one 10 minute break. As long as you have studied you will be able to pass.</p>
